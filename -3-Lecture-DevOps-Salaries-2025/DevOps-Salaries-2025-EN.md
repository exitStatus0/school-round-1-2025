## 4) Career Ladder → Actions That Convert to $$

### 4.1 Junior → First Job (goal: ~ $1–1.1k in UA / €35–50k in EU)
1. **Portfolio, not diploma.** 3–4 production-like projects: K8s cluster (IaC), CI/CD to cloud, monitoring+alerts, secrets.  
2. **Open Source/contribution.** PR to Helm-chart/operator, public Terraform modules, GitHub profile README.  
3. **Entry certifications:** *AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) / Azure AZ-900 / GCP Cloud Digital Leader*, then one **Associate** (AWS SAA-C03 or Azure AZ-104 / GCP ACE). *(Docker DCA is outdated, focus on K8s/Cloud).*  
4. **Show English.** Demo video explaining architecture (5–7 min), README in English.

### 4.2 Middle (2–5 years) → Upper Range
1. **Specialization + automation.** Mastery in Terraform/K8s + one of: **ArgoCD/GitOps**, **Ansible**, **Crossplane**, **Pulumi**.  
2. **Soft skills:** task/project leadership, mentoring juniors, clear RFC/ADR, operational documentation.  
3. **Advanced certs:** **CKA/CKAD/CKS**, **Terraform Associate**, **AWS: SAA-C03/DevOps-Pro/SA-Pro** or **Azure AZ-305**, **GCP PDE** — choose based on company stack.  
4. **FinOps+Security** as differentiator: reduce infra costs in $$ and close audits — this sells in interviews.

### 4.3 Senior (5–10 years) → 130–190k$ in global context / upper EU ranges
1. **Lead major initiatives:** cloud migrations, multi-region HA, DevSecOps across entire SDLC, SRE-class SLO/reliability.  
2. **Architecture and platform:** IDP, service catalogs, automated golden paths, policy-as-code across all environments.  
3. **Expertise visibility:** blogs/talks/OSS-maintaining, stack interviews/cases — this directly adds to TC.  
4. **Negotiation preparation:** researched ranges, alternative offers, package (bonus/RSU/options/relocation).

### 4.4 Lead/Head/Director → Strategy and Multi-team Impact
- **Business acumen:** budgets/ROI/risks, product portfolio, OKR alignment, roadmaps.  
- **Operational maturity:** error budgets, incidents/action backlogs, platform as product (NPS dev teams).  
- **Network/brand:** community, conferences, panels, articles — this is a career multiplier.  
- **Continuous learning:** AI tools for DevOps, people management, compliance/security changes.

## 5) Market and Work Formats (remote/onsite/B2B/UoP)

- **Remote is default** for DevOps/SRE. International companies pay **location-adjusted**, but for Senior+/Lead the difference blurs.  
- **B2B vs UoP (PL):** B2B — higher "take-home", but no paid vacations/sick leave; UoP — social guarantees, pension. Choose based on life circumstances.  
- **Compensation = Base + Bonus + Equity + Perks.** In EU equity is less than in USA, but bonuses/benefits are more stable.  
- **Taxes/CoL:** compare net and expenses (housing/kindergarten/healthcare) — "more gross" isn't always "better net".

---

## 6) 90-Day Roadmap (practical)

**Weeks 1–2:** skills audit → choose target market (UA/EU remote). Update resume, LinkedIn, GitHub.  
**Weeks 3–6:** 2 public projects (IaC+K8s+CI/CD+Observability). Demo video + LinkedIn post.  
**Weeks 7–8:** prepare for **CKA** or **Terraform Associate** (one cert in 4–6 weeks is realistic).  
**Weeks 9–10:** mock interviews, arch-design tasks, SRE cases, security questions.  
**Weeks 11–12:** apply sprint (30–50 targeted applications/week), 2–3 technical interviews/week.  
**Outcome:** raise range/transition to more solvent company.

### ✍️ Lecture Closing Scenario (30 sec)

"DevOps in 2025 is about **platform thinking**, **security by default**, **cloud economics**, and **smart AI application**. If you have **production K8s + IaC + GitOps + SRE practices** and know how to **communicate** about it, your compensation level grows as much as you can defend in interviews. Choose a 90-day focus and move forward."
