## 👋 Introduction
Hello! Welcome to the school of practical and pragmatic DevOps called **`exitStatus0`**.

## 🎯 Who is this school for?
This is a **free and charitable school** that I created for those who want to:  
- learn to think like a pragmatic engineer,  
- gain practical DevOps skills,  
- dive deep into modern technologies without "fluff".  

My name is **Yaroslav**. For over 20 years, I have been working in the field that today is called DevOps and Software Development.  
I went from self-education to learning from the best masters in the industry, and added a lot of my own effort to become one of the leading specialists.  
Now I work as a technical leader in a product company and want to pass on my experience to you.

## 🔥 School Mission
I strive to teach you:  
- **practical skills** that are needed in real work,  
- **engineering thinking** that helps solve complex problems,  
- **to accept challenges and overcome them**, igniting within yourself the technogenic fire of Prometheus and the spirit of cyber-techno-cossack ⚡️.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
For learning, you will need:  
- minimal/intermediate level of English **or** willingness to use translators,  
- **your own computer** with internet access,  
- **time and patience** — this is a marathon for medium and long distances.  

The technologies we will study are deep and sometimes complex.  
Don't expect to master the profession in 2 weeks or a month. We will **learn together, laugh, sometimes give up and return**, grow, gain muscle, confidence in ourselves and our strengths, and overcome circumstances and our weaknesses 💪.
