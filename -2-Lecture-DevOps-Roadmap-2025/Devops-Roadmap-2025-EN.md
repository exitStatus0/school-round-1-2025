## 🎭 Short analogy (choose your option)

### ⚽ Football team
- **Cloud** — stadium with infrastructure (lighting, field, turnstiles).  
- **Kubernetes** — squad manager and lineup: decides who "plays" (pods), makes substitutions (restarts/rollouts), scales the "bench" (autoscaling).  
- **CI/CD** — head coach and staff: set tactics (pipeline), conduct warm-up (build/tests), release new scheme to the field (deploy).  
- **Git** — playbook and tactics archive with change history.  
- **Containers and registry** — "player contracts" and squad database: standardized images ready to play.  
- **Observability** — analytics, telemetry, VAR (Video Assistant Referee in football) and tracking: metrics/logs/traces for real-time decisions.  
- **Security** — security, turnstiles, ticket checking: secrets, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), image signatures, policies.  
- **GitOps** — approved tactics from repository that automatically apply on the field.  
- **AI/AIOps** — analytical staff with AI: suggests substitutions, notices foul-"anomalies", predicts fatigue (capacity/cost).

### 🏭 Robot manufacturing plant
- **Cloud** — industrial site and energy; **CI/CD** — assembly/testing/shipping conveyor.  
- **Kubernetes** — shop floor dispatcher: distributes work between lines (nodes), maintains pace, adds robot arms as needed.  
- **Git** — drawing management system (BoM (Bill of Materials)/recipes).  
- **Containers** — standardized modules that easily transport between shops; **registry** — warehouse of ready modules.  
- **IaC (Terraform/Pulumi)** — plant master plan and shop specifications as code.  
- **Ansible** — work instructions for thousands of similar operations.  
- **SBOM/SLSA** — component specifications and supply chain certification.  
- **Observability (OTel (Open Telemetry for metrics/logs/traces (OpenTelemetry))/Prometheus)** — sensors, SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition), quality control.  
- **Policy-as-Code/OPA/Kyverno** — technical conditions: without compliance — part doesn't pass.  
- **AI/AIOps** — predictive maintenance, line pace optimization, defect detection.

### 🧠 Human body
- **Kubernetes** — "autonomous nervous system": distributes load between organs/cells (pods), restores damaged areas (self-healing).  
- **CI/CD** — blood circulation and hormonal system: delivers nutrients/signals (builds/releases) to the right organ at the right time.  
- **Git** — "memory/instructions" of the organism: change history and clear action recipes.  
- **Containers** — cells with standard "plan" (image), **registry** — bone marrow "supplies".  
- **IaC (Infrastructure as Code)** — "genetic programs" for tissue and organ development as infrastructure code.  
- **Observability** — tests, ECG, pulse oximeter (metrics/logs/traces, SLI (Service Level Indicator)/SLO).  
- **Immunity = Security** — detects threats, blocks infections (RBAC, signatures, scanning).  
- **AI/AIOps** — "cortex" for learning and faster decisions: interprets symptoms, advises therapy (remediation).  
- **Policy-as-Code** — "homeostasis": rules for maintaining parameters within normal limits.

> 🎉 You confidently work in terminal, understand how traffic flows, and can independently build/push container images.

---

## 📦 Stage 2 — Fundamentals (packaging and storage) - Strong Junior, Fresh Mid level

> 🎯 **Goal:** be able to package applications and store artifacts transparently and reproducibly.

### 📚 **What to learn**
- **Containerization:** Dockerfile best practices (cache, multi-stage build, non-root).
- **Registries and storage:** Docker registry, tagging rules, immutability, retention.
- **Artifacts:** npm/Maven/Gradle, when artifact-repo (Nexus/Artifactory) is needed alongside registry.
- **Cloud 101:** compute, networks, storage, IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles, VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)/Subnets, SG (Security Group)/NACL).  

### 🛠️ **Minimum practice**
- Convert simple application to multi-stage build, sign image (SBOM/signing), push to private registry.
- Deploy minimal infrastructure in cloud (one VM + private registry or managed).

### ✅ **Result**
> 🎉 You have reproducible containers, clear tagging scheme, and basic cloud understanding.

---

## ⚙️ Stage 3 — Core (Kubernetes + CI/CD) - Strong Mid, Soon to be Senior

> 🎯 **Goal:** automate build, testing, and deployment; manage environments through Kubernetes.

### 📚 **What to learn**
- **Kubernetes:** Pods/Deployments/Services/Ingress, ConfigMap/Secret, HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), Requests/Limits, RBAC, Namespace isolation.
- **GitOps (mandatory in 2025):** declarative manifests, sync, drift detection, promotion between environments.

- **Basic security:** secrets management, image scanning, least-privilege RBAC, network policies.

### 🛠️ **Minimum practice**
- Local cluster (**kind (Kubernetes in Docker)**/k3d), one service, one cronjob, ingress, autoscaling.
- Set up **GitOps** repository for stage/prod (two namespaces, separate values).
- CI: linter → tests → image build → signing → publication → auto-deploy to stage via GitOps.

### ✅ **Result**
> 🎉 Full cycle from commit to release is code-managed; clusters and environments are reproducible.

---

## 🏆 Stage 4 — Mastery level (IaC, config management, observability), finally - Senior

> 🎯 **Goal:** manage infrastructure as code, see system through and quickly recover from failures.

### 📚 **What to learn**
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform/Pulumi, modules, state, change planning, multi-account/multi-region.
- **Config management:** Ansible (idempotency, inventory, roles), preferably with IaC.
- **Observability:** metrics/logs/traces (OpenTelemetry), Prometheus/Grafana approach, alerts, SLI/SLO, error budget.
- **Advanced security:** secrets, signatures, **SBOM**, reproducible builds, policies (OPA (Open Policy Agent)/Kyverno).

### 🛠️ **Minimum practice**
- Describe VPC/cluster/repositories as IaC code; spin up/tear down environment with one command.
- Build SLO (Service Level Objective) dashboard and set up alerts for latency/errors/saturation.

### ✅ **Result**
> 🎉 Infrastructure and configurations are fully declarative, with state overview and quick recovery.

- **Copilot approach:** generating YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)/Jenkinsfile/Terraform modules from hints; pipeline templating.
- **Anomalies and incidents:** AI analysis of metrics/logs/traces, explaining spikes, root cause hints.
- **Tests and environments:** generating mocks/data, fuzz testing, test matrix suggestions.
- **ChatOps (Chat Operations):** integration with chats for releases, rollbacks, statuses; coordinated prompts/roles.
- **Cost and performance optimization:** resource recommendations, scaling planning.
- **AI security:** access control, request/response logging, data usage policies, avoiding secret leakage.

> **Practice:** add AI step to CI (manifest review), set up experimental AIOps alert analysis, describe safe AI usage policy for the team.

### 2) 🏗️ **Platform Engineering and IDP (Internal Developer Portal)**
- Self-service: service catalogs, templates (golden paths), standardized pipelines.
- Definitions as code: services/resources/environments in one place; integration with GitOps and SSO (Single Sign-On).
- Better DX (Developer Experience): accelerating onboarding, reducing "manual" platform requests.

> **Practice:** describe one "golden path" (service template) and automate service creation through portal.

### 3) 🔒 **Secure Supply Chain (SBOM/SLSA)**
- **SBOM** for every release; dependency validation; signature verification; isolated builders.
- Artifact provenance reconstruction, audit, policies for blocking risky components.

> **Practice:** generate SBOM during build, add validation to CI-gates, store SBOM alongside artifacts.

### 4) 🔄 **GitOps+ & Policy-as-Code**
- Automatic drift detection and remediation, **progressive delivery** (canaries, blue-green), approvals with policies.
- **OPA/Kyverno** for security and compliance: resources, limits, network policies, image provenance.

> **Practice:** add policy-gate for PR: without limits/resources or unsigned image — deployment forbidden.

### 5) 🔍 **eBPF and WASM**
- **eBPF:** deep kernel/network observability without high overhead.
- **WASM:** lightweight, portable plugins/sidecars/tasks with clearer isolation.

> **Practice:** connect eBPF tool for latency profiling; try simple WASM plugin in service-mesh/ingress.

### 6) 💰 **FinOps & GreenOps**
- Cost transparency, budgets/quotas, right-sizing; energy consumption assessment, "green" metrics.
- CI/CD integration: cost-diff in PR, budget overrun alerts.

> **Practice:** add resource tagging, basic cost dashboard and cost comments in PR.

### 7) 🌐 **Edge/IoT CI/CD** (optional)
- Small node fleet, unstable connection, wave updates, remote telemetry, image/package signatures.
